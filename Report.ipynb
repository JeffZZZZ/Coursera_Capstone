Most of people never suffer from security threat or hunger, the basic needs are also be satisfied. Thus, the happiness of life significantly depends on some higher level deisres such as more delicate food and drink, diversified entertainment and deeper education. These indicators can be quantificated as the number of restaurants, entertainment facilities and schools.\n<br>\nThe objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to cluster the neighbourhoods of Toronto, count the number of venues, and find out the area where people will be the most happy to live in.\n<br>\nThe potential users would be everyone that is interested to move to Ottawa and begin their new life."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2.
